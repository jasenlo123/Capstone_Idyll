[p className:'hed']Introduction & Summary[/p]
Jack Ma's Alibaba Group acquired the South China Morning Post (SCMP) is an award-winning English-language newspaper based in Hong Kong in April 2016, hoping to use SCMP to counter negative coverage of China in the media landscape. Detractors of the SCMP's new editorial direction concerned about the editorial independence of the Post have levied the following accusations against the publication:

* SCMP is shifting its editorial focus from producing content about Hong Kong to writing more about news on China.

* SCMP's coverage of China after the acquisition is much less critical, as news stories about China have a more positive tone compared to the coverage produced before the acquisition.

This article investigates these two accusations using natural language processing and machine learning methods. The author scraped all of SCMP's 92,000 news articles from 2012 - 2020, and analyses the title and topic tags of these articles to quantitatively determine if these accusations are valid. To summarise, this article found that SCMP has shifted more of its editorial focus to China, writing much more about China following Alibaba's acquisition. In addition, the China coverage of SCMP has significantly softened in tone, as a sentiment analysis of SCMP's articles about China reveal a much more positive sentiment in article titles following the Alibaba's acquisition.

[p className:'hed']Context & History of SCMP[/p]
The *South China Morning Post* (SCMP) is an award-winning English-language newspaper based in Hong Kong. SCMP has a storied history as one of the most influential newspapers in Asia. It was not only the paper of record for Hong Kong, but also the English-language paper of record for reporting on China.

For decades, SCMP has reported on topics such as 
[a href:'https://www.scmp.com/topics/bo-xilai' target:"_blank"] political scandals 
[/a] and 
[a href: 'https://www.scmp.com/topics/tiananmen-square-crackdown' target:"_blank"] human-rights
[/a] 
[a href: 'https://www.scmp.com/topics/xinjiang' target: "_blank"] abuses
[/a] that Chinese state media are forbidden to cover, even after the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China. Combined with Hong Kong's position as the gateway of business and finance into China, SCMP was considered and continues to be viewed as the public voice of Hong Kong on Chinese affairs, and thus a relevant read for anyone one with an interest in China.

Throughout most of the paper's history, SCMP conducted exclusive and aggressive reportage on China. However, since 1993, the ownership of the Post has 
[a href:'https://www.asiasentinel.com/p/alibaba-buys-south-china-morning-post-counter-western-bias']
changed hands twice
[/a] to owners that are much less inclined to potentially negative reportage of the Chinese government due to extensive business interests in China. Kerry Group, controlled by Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok, acquired SCMP in 1993, while Chinese multinational technology company Alibaba Group, led by founder Jack Ma, took over the ownership of the Post in April, 2016.

Following Kerry Group's acquisition,

[/a] as the paper's reporting became less critical of Chinese leadership and the paper was

[/a] of self-censorship and toeing a pro-Beijing line. However, the change in editorial slant way was not explicit until Alibaba's acquisition of the Post. Joseph C. Tsai, Alibabaâ€™s executive vice chairman, 
[a href: 'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/business/dealbook/alibaba-scmp-south-china-morning-post.html' target:"_blank"] said
[/a] that Alibaba "wanted to use the paper to counteract the negative portrayal of China in the western media".


Although Jack Ma has 
[a href: 'https://fr.reuters.com/article/us-alibaba-scmp-idUSKCN0XI08S' target:"_blank"] promised
[/a]  not to interfere in SCMP editorial decisions, SCMP's erosion of editorial independence has been the subject of stories by other publications: 
[a href: 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/world/asia/south-china-morning-post-hong-kong-alibaba.html' target:"_blank"] *The New York Times* 
[/a] referred to the SCMP as a 'newspaper on a mission to promote China's soft power" in 2018, while 
[a href: 'https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/08/scmp-hong-kong-china-media/614719/' target:"_blank"] *The Atlantic* 
[/a] called the Post a 'newsroom at the Edge of Autocracy' in 2020.

[p className:'hed']Shifting Editorial Priorities[/p]

Former SCMP contributor Stephen Vines noted in a 2018 opt-ed for the Hong Kong Free Press, another English-language publication based in Hong Kong, that 'local news (about Hong Kong) has been largely removed from the main news section' of SCMP. Vines' claim seemed to be in-line with SCMP's new ownership to focus the publication's editorial focus onto China. Using the scraped SCMP dataset, the author was able to count the number of news articles that SCMP wrote about China and Hong Kong in order to quantify the effect that Vines hinted at in his opt-ed. 

The metric that is used as a proxy for editorial priority on China versus Hong Kong is the ratio between the number of yearly articles written on China and the number of yearly articles written on Hong Kong. 
[br/]
[br/]
// equation for derive metric
[Equation]
  \text{China:HK Ratio} = {\text{Number of China Articles}} / {\text{Number of HK Articles}}
[/Equation]

  [Step]
  ### This chart shows the ratio of SCMP news articles written about China to Hong Kong from 2012 - 2015. 
  ### The ratio hovers around 0.5 in this time period, meaning that for every 5 story written by SCMP about China, SCMP produced approximately 10 articles about Hong Kong. [/Step]
  [Step]### Alibaba acquired SCMP for $266 million in April, 2016, transfering control of SCMP from Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok to Chinese billionaire Jack Ma. [/Step]
  [Step]### In the next full year (2017) after Alibaba's acqusition of SCMP, the ratio of stories written about China compared to Hong Kong increases substantially.  [/Step]
  [Step]### From 2017 - 2019, the ratio of news articles written about China to Hong Kong is around 0.7. This means that SCMP wrote 7 news articles about China for every 10 news articles written about Hong Kong. [/Step]
  [Step]### The increasing ratio trend continues to hold until today.[/Step]
  [Step]###  This year, the ratio of China to Hong Kong news stories produced by SCMP is at an all-time high. [/Step]
[/Scroller] // end scrollie

[section className:"article-body"]
The visualisation above demonstrates that SCMP has shifted and continues to shift more of its editorial content production on China since Alibaba's acquisition in April, 2016. SCMP produced 2 more articles about China for every 10 articles about Hong Kong following the Alibaba acquisition.
