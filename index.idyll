[p className:'hed']Introduction[/p]
The *South China Morning Post* (SCMP) is an award-winning English-language newspaper based in Hong Kong. SCMP has a storied history as one of the most influential newspapers in Asia. It was not only the paper of record for Hong Kong, but also the English-language paper of record for reporting on China. Even when China was closed off to the rest of the world, the Post was one of the few sources of English-medium information available about happenings in China. 

For decades, SCMP has reported on topics such as 
[a href:'https://www.scmp.com/topics/bo-xilai' target:"_blank"] political scandals 
[/a] and 
[a href: 'https://www.scmp.com/topics/tiananmen-square-crackdown' target:"_blank"] human-rights
[/a] 
[a href: 'https://www.scmp.com/topics/xinjiang' target: "_blank"] abuses
[/a] that Chinese state media are forbidden to cover, even after the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China. Combined with Hong Kong's position as the gateway of business and finance into China, SCMP was considered and continues to be viewed as the public voice of Hong Kong on Chinese affairs, and thus a relevant read for anyone one with an interest in China.

SCMP was owned by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch during the early 1990s, and conducted exclusive and aggressive reportage on China. Since then, the ownership of the Post has 
[a href:'https://www.asiasentinel.com/p/alibaba-buys-south-china-morning-post-counter-western-bias']
changed hands twice
[/a] to owners that are much less inclined to potentially negative reportage of the Chinese government due to extensive business interests in China. Kerry Group, controlled by Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok, acquired SCMP in 1993, while Chinese multinational technology company Alibaba Group, led by founder Jack Ma, took over the ownership of the Post in April, 2016. 

Following Kerry Group's acquisition,

[/a] as the paper's reporting became less critical of Chinese leadership and the paper was

[/a] of self-censorship and toeing a pro-Beijing line. However, the change in editorial slant way was not explicit until Alibaba's acquisition of the Post. Joseph C. Tsai, Alibabaâ€™s executive vice chairman, 
[a href: 'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/business/dealbook/alibaba-scmp-south-china-morning-post.html' target:"_blank"] said
[/a] that Alibaba "wanted to use the paper to counteract the negative portrayal of China in the western media".

Although Jack Ma has 
[a href: 'https://fr.reuters.com/article/us-alibaba-scmp-idUSKCN0XI08S' target:"_blank"] promised
[/a]  not to interfere in SCMP editorial decisions, SCMP's erosion of editorial independence has been the subject of stories by other publications: 
[a href: 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/world/asia/south-china-morning-post-hong-kong-alibaba.html' target:"_blank"] *The New York Times* 
[/a] referred to the SCMP as a 'newspaper on a mission to promote China's soft power" in 2018, while 
[a href: 'https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/08/scmp-hong-kong-china-media/614719/' target:"_blank"] *The Atlantic* 
[/a] called the Post a 'newsroom at the Edge of Autocracy' in 2020.
